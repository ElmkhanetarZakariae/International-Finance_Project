# Project Overview:

For this analysis, I will be examining Meta Platforms, Inc. (formerly Facebook), focusing on two significant recent developments impacting the company’s performance and future outlook:

# GDPR Compliance and Data Protection Challenges
This development focuses on Meta’s ongoing efforts to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its challenges in safeguarding user data, particularly in Europe. The regulatory pressure and potential fines could have implications for Meta’s reputation and bottom line.
# Investments in Artificial Intelligence and the Metaverse
Meta’s significant financial commitment to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its pivot toward building the Metaverse are reshaping its long-term strategy. This development explores how these investments could affect Meta’s financial performance and its competitive positioning in the tech industry.

# The project will address the following key components:

# Analysis of Recent Developments:
Evaluate how the two chosen developments—GDPR compliance and investments in AI and the Metaverse—have already impacted Meta’s financial position or may affect its financial outlook in the near future.
# Evaluation of Financial and Risk Management Strategies:
Analyze Meta’s sources of finance and dividend policy, and assess how these elements have influenced the company’s financial performance, especially in light of the challenges posed by GDPR and the ongoing investments in new technologies.
# Financial Ratio Analysis: 
Using Meta’s most recent annual report, I will conduct a detailed financial performance analysis covering profitability, liquidity, and investment ratios over the most recent two consecutive financial periods (e.g., 2022/23 or 2023/24). This will provide insight into Meta's overall financial health and its ability to navigate the challenges and opportunities arising from these developments.

# By the end of this project, I aim to present a comprehensive understanding of how Meta’s strategic decisions, financial management, and external challenges shape its financial trajectory.
